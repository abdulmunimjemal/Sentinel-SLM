# Task Completion Checklist

- If training or model changes were made, run evaluation notebook: `notebooks/05_test_rail_a.ipynb`.
- If preparing or modifying datasets, consider running `scripts/inspect_rail_a.py` to validate stats.
- If finalizing models, use `scripts/finalize_rail_a.py` with the intended checkpoint path.
